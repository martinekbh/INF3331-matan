Exercise 4.6 said to name this file "report4.txt", but i assumed this was a
typo.
Below is the output of integrator_comparison.py.


N needs to be at least 90700 to have an error less than 10^(-10)
when integrating with midpoint_integrate
N needs to be at least 128300 to have an error less than 10^(-10)
when integrating with numpy_midpoint_integrate
I = 2.000000
