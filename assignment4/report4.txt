I updated the file integrating_time.py to also asses the numba_integrate
method, and plot the results of using the different integration methods on
f=x^3 with three different N-values (10^6, 10^7, and 10^8). The plot is saved as
Runtime_integration.png.

As evidenced from the plot, numba doesn't seem to perform that mush quicker
than numpy, which is an unexpected result. I am unsure if implemented numba
correctly..
