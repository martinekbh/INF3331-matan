\subsection*{General feedback}

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a very good solution, well documented and everything we have tested is working. Very detailed and informative reports. Everything is easy to read, with good function names etc.

\subsection*{Assignment 4.1}

<<<<<<< HEAD
All is working as expected, and the tests have meaningful names, all starting with test\_.
The code is very easy to read and also written in a pythonic way. No unnecessarily complicated parts. The usage of error threshold 10E-10 that you commented about is fine. The original assignment test had, as mentioned on Piazza by instructor, a bit too strict suggested threshold.

\subsection*{Assignment 4.2} \label{sec:assignment5.2}

<<<<<<< HEAD
Working as expected, passes test. Nice that you both use python docstring as well as comments.
Easy enough to read, but you could use more descriptive variable names; "integral" instead of "I". Good plot.
=======
Working as expected and documentation where its needed.
Easy to read aswell.

def integrate(f, a, b, N):
    """
    Integration method that does not use any python modules (numpy)
    """
    n = (b-a)/float(N) #Interval length
    I = 0.0 # Will be value of integrated function
    m = 0 # Counter
    for i in range(1, int(N)):
        m += 1
        I += f(a + i*n)*n
    I += f(b)*n
    return I
\end{minted}

<<<<<<< HEAD
The only thing i see is that the "m" counter here is not doing anything.

\subsection*{Assignment 4.3}

Working as expected and documentation where its needed.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Program is easy to read.
Numpy vectorization is used effectively.
Good report with informative explanations.
Nice that you made a dedicated testing.py program.
=======
Easy to read.
Numpy is used effectively. (Use of vectorization)
Good informative report

\subsection*{Assignment 4.4}

Working as expected and documentation where its needed.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Easy to read. Again a well written report with elaborate explanations. Good that you explained that vectorized functions don't work in numba. In regards to numba performance: Numba loses some initial lead by having to compile methods before they are ran, which are then ready the next time.
=======
Easy to read. Good informative report. Good that you included the part about vectorized functions not working in numba.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Well explained report, also good that you comment on the accuracy of your N values.
=======
Easy to read. Good and informative report.
