As can be seen, i didn't get to finish exercise 5.5 completely.
While the idea of the all_the_emails function is written down, unexpected
changes had to be made to the other functions (find_urls and find_emails)
for different reasons. One is that the re.findall searches were too strict on
the form the urls and emails are supposed to have in HTML. For example did the
searches not account for newlines in between <a and </a> in the urls. See the
code in find_urls for some comments.
